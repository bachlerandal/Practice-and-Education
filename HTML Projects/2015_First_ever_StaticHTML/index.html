            Hi. My name is Randal Bachle.  I am a new student at <abbr title="Univesity of Nebraska at Omaha"><span class="bold">UNO</span></abbr> , studying Computer Science. I went bald at age 15, have a slipped disc in my lumbar region, and <abbr title="Dungeon Master"><span class="bold">DM</span></abbr> for a ragtag group of adventurers that spend more of their time getting in trouble with the law than they do actually going on quests.  I hope to someday work on games officially (They haven't paid for any of my MODs yet) or work with cyber security.
            </p>

            <p> 
            I have been big into gaming ever since I bought my first computer and acquired an internet connection when I was 17.  I particularly enjoy games with RPG elements that can be played by multiple people (be it an MMO or localy).  I work a little bit with the Unreal engines to make my own simple games or 3d models that can be used for other people using the same platform to make their own projects.
            </p>

            <p>
            While I was in the service, I was introduced to all the crazy tech that one could employ for intelligence uses.  I was fascinated by the programs and resources employed to not only track down the bad guys, but also keep our buddies safe.  I utilized TigerNet, Palantir, Analyst Notebook, DTMS, SIPR Google, Centrix assets, BlueForceTracker, ect.  You name a militarized intelligence program and chances are I have used it extensively.

            After High School, I attended <abbr title="University of Nebraska at Kearney"><span class="bold">UNK</span></abbr>, majoring in Biochemistry fast tracked for Medicine.  I then took a short vacation with the Army and visited many wondrous places like Afghanistan and Iraq. There, I received further education that focused primarily on jumping out of planes or getting shot at (you recieve better marks if you can do both without getting killed).

            I like to stay physically active and enjoy my times outdoors.  I bowhunt, shoot both rifles and bows competitively, rockclimb, and weight lift.  For one short summer, I was an instructor for a <abbr title="Close Quarters Battle">CQB</abbr> course that taught its students how to engage and survive in modern, close proximity, firefights with varying equipment.
            </p>

            <p>
            I read daily, and try to finish at least one novel a week.  I am a big Sci-fi and Fantasy junky.  Some of my favorite authors are Terry Goodkind, David Gemmel, Orson Scott Card, and Mark Twain (I know Twain doesnt match the genre, but the man is just hilarious).  While novels are all well and good, I also try to read at least one informative work a month. I just finished "Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age", by Bernard Carlson.  I very much recommend it.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course, if I'm not reading or outside, I'm at my computer gaming or modding (which to me is gaming anyway).  My latest obsessions are Ark: Survival Evolved (A survival rpg sandbox crafter game..with dinsosaurs!), the upcoming Fallout 4, and Hearthstone when I'm feeling lazy and uncommitted. I occasionally revisit the classics with my buddies if we all have the time.  Our weekends usually consist of Age of Empires II, Civilization 3-5, Age of Wonders, Company of Heroes, Starcraft/Warcraft, and the occasionaly <abbr title="Multiplayer Online Battle Arena"><span class="bold">MOBA</span></abbr>, like Heroes of Newerth or League of Legends.  It usually ends with someone rage quitting and then a pizza party for everyone to become friends again.
